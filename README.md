# Loading-Images-in-Keras
## CNN Training Pipeline
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have had great success in certain kinds of problems, such as image recognition. Data loading and preparation are important steps when it comes to working with such models. Increasingly, data augmentation is also required for more complex object recognition tasks. In this lab, we will discover various ways of loading images, as well as converting, augmenting and saving image datasets using the Keras API.
